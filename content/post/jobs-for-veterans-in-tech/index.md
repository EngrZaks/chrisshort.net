## To potential employers

I spent eleven years (1999-2010) in the Air Force. I spent my time working in information technology and intelligence arenas. I learned so much about globally distributed systems and the world as a whole during my years of service. My assignments and experiences taught me to never rest on my laurels. The self confidence required to do great work in high-pressure environments is a skill that people aren't born with. A pair of skills the military instilled in me that gives me an upper hand are: continous learning and adaptibility. I welcome folks thirsting to learn and who are able to adapt operations to advance towards strategic goals. You should too.

## To veterans seeking a job in tech

You better step your game up. Leave your pride, rank, and medals at the door when you walk in for your interview.
