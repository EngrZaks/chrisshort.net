I had the pleasure of attending DevOpsDays Chicago this week. I wanted to share some of the things I picked up from the event with a wider audience. Also, shout out to Sasha Rosenbaum, Matty Stratton, and the entire DevOpsDays Chicago staff. They put on a very wonderful, thoughtful, and diverse event. I have a day job and medical stuff I deal with so I am in and out often. If I don't mention a talk please don't take it as it wasn't worthy of mention. I probably had to step out.

Also, an interesting note, the only time I heard the word Kubernetes on day one was when someone jokingly mentioned it as an open space.

## Ethics with Jeff Smith

The first talk of Day 1 was a thought provoking, expertly delivered talk on ethics by [Jeff Smith](https://twitter.com/DarkAndNerdy). I was happy to see there is someone other than me that sees their day-to-day work as having further impact than their keyboard. I appreciate the fact that Jeff highlighted that all the things that we do day-to-day could have positive intent but still be used for bad things. Even if you right good code it can still be applied to do bad things.

Jeff believes that with all the privacy concerns we have it's probably time to turn the table on privacy. Instead of accepting a ten page legal document, people need to be presented with a single screen, Android style permission **consent**. Informed consent is everything.

Also, Jeff pointed out that his barber needs a license to cut his hair in the state of Illinois but any random person in the audience could work on aircraft flight systems code. Conversely, Jeff pointed out the fact that regulatory requirements and licensing can also be barriers to entry. Tech has lifted up so many people because they could learn, build, and do things without necessarily having to get a permit, license, or join a formal organization.

This was the perfect talk for first thing in the morning. It attempted to place everyone's mind in the open position for the day and I think it hit a home run.
