It was a bright, Saturday morning, July 4, 2020. I had just gotten Max all situated with breakfast and cartoons when I sat down to plow through the week's personal email. "Oh look, the AWS bill, I should have a laugh at that," I thought to myself. Normally it's pennies a month for some very light SES usage. In February, I moved off Google Cloud back to AWS. Along with that came the CDN for this web site (cdn.chrisshort.net). When I say CDN, I mean a Cloudflare fronted, S3 bucket that holds assets deemed too big for git (not even the site itself; less than 300 files). That made bumped the AWS bill to an average of $23/month.

Not on this Saturday morning, nope. June 2020's AWS bill was a heart palpitation causing **$2,657.68** ([PDF](/pdf/invoice498711077_redacted.pdf)).
